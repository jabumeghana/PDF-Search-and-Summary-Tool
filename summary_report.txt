DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 1 | Transaction:
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 1 | as a transaction. Logical work can be inserting a new value in the current database,
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 1 | For example, adding a new member to the database of a team is a transaction.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 1 | To complete a transaction, we have to follow some steps which make a transaction
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 1 | successful. For example, we withdraw the cash from ATM is an example of a transaction,
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 1 | Initialization if transaction
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 1 | Aborting the transaction
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 1 | So, in the same way, we have three steps in the DBMS for a transaction which are the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 2 | PROPERTIES OF TRANSACTION(ACIDPROPERTIES):
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 2 |  This property states that all of the instructions with in a transaction

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 2 | Commit:If a transaction commits, changes made are
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 2 |  Consider the following transaction T consisting of T1 and T2:
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 2 |  If the transaction fails after completion of
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 3 | state.Therefore,the transactionmustbe executed in entirety in order to
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 3 | performing any kind of transaction ensuring correctness of
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 3 |  If we execute a particular transaction in isolation(or)together with
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 3 | other transaction in multiprogramming environment ,the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 3 | transaction should give same result in any case.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 3 |  Each transaction, run by itself with no concurrent execution of
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 3 | other transactions, must preserve the consistency of the database.

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 4 |  This property ensures that once the transaction has completed
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 4 | Transaction states:
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 4 | Every transaction undergoes several states in its execution. A
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 4 | transaction can be in any one of the following states:
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 4 | Transaction state diagram
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 5 | Active - This is the first state of transaction and here the transaction is
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 5 | we say transaction it will have set of small steps, and those steps
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 5 | the transaction is executed. But data is still not saved to the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 5 | Committed - In this state, all the transactions are permanently saved to
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 5 | the database. This step is the last step of a transaction, if it
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 5 | Failed - If a transaction cannot proceed to the execution state because
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 5 | of the failure of the system or database, then the transaction is
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 5 | first step of transaction, then the transaction will fail to execute.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 6 | transaction will start its execution from a fresh start or from a
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 6 | changes to the database as a result of any transaction after
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 6 | committing the transaction.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 6 | In the shadow-copy scheme, a transaction that wants to update the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 6 | If at any point the transaction has to be aborted, the system merely
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 6 | If the transaction completes, it is committed as follows.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 7 | We now consider how the technique handles transaction and system failures.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 7 | First, consider transaction failure. If the transaction fails at any time
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 7 | the database. Once the transaction has been committed, all the updates
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 7 | either all updates of the transaction are reflected, or none of the effects
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 7 | are reflected, regardless of transaction failure.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 7 |  Partial transaction should be avoided for ensuring atomicity and durability.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 7 |  Logs keep track of actions carried out by transactions which
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 7 |  When a transaction begins its execution it is recorded in the log as
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 8 |  When a transaction performs an operation it is recorded in log as follows
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 8 |  When a transaction finishes it’s execution, it is recorded as

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 8 | TRANSACTION SCHEDULES:
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 8 |  It refers to the list of actions to be executed by transaction.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 8 |  A schedule is a process of grouping the transactions into one and
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 8 | In the serial schedule the transactions are allowed to execute one
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 8 | A schedule is called serial schedule,if the transactions in the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 8 | Concurrent schedule allows the transaction to be executed in inter leaved
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 9 | It is a schedule of transactions where each transaction is committed before
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 9 | terminating. The example is shown below where transactions T1 and T2
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 9 | terminates after committing the transactions.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 9 | A transaction is said to be Serializable if it is equivalent to
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 10 |  They belong to different transactions.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 10 | It refers to two instructions of two different transactions may want to
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 10 |  If two different transactions are both for read operation, then
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 10 |  If both transactions performing write operation then there will be
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 10 | in conflict so ordering the transaction can be done.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 11 | Two schedules S1 and S2 over the same set of transactions—any
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 11 | transaction that appears in either S1 or S2 must also appear in the other
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 11 | For each data object A, the transaction (if any) that performs the final
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 11 | the transactions in both schedules performs the actions in similar

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 14 | an ongoing transaction.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 15 | SAVEPOINT command is used to temporarily save a transaction
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 15 | Isolation: Locking can ensure that transactions are executed
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 15 | in isolation from other transactions, preventing interference
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 16 | between transactions and reducing the risk of data
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 16 | transactions are waiting for each other to release resources,
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 16 | transactions from completing. Deadlocks can be difficult to
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 17 | complex transactional logic. This complexity can lead to
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 18 | database by transaction T2 while transaction T1is
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 18 | by transaction T2 while transaction T1 is using the

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 21 | Before initiating an execution, the transaction

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 22 |  In the first part,when the transaction starts
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 22 |  The second part is where the transaction
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 22 | transaction releases its first lock, the third
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 22 |  In third phase, the transaction cannot
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 22 | In Growing Phase, a transaction obtains locks, but may
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 23 | In Shrinking Phase, a transaction may release locks, but
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 23 | transaction; and the second phase is shrinking,
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 23 | where the locks held by the transaction are being
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 23 | To claim an exclusive(write) lock, a transaction must

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 24 | cannot read it until first transaction
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 24 | i.e.when the transaction starts executing,it seeks
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 24 | phase,the transaction continues to execute

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 26 | Suppose there are there transactions T1, T2, and T3.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 26 | Priority will be given to transaction T1, then transaction T2 and

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 26 | No waiting for the transaction, which eliminates the

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 35 | Transaction failure
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 35 | Transaction failure: A transaction needs to abort once it
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 35 | known as transaction failure wherever solely many
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 35 | transactions or processes are hurt. The reasons for
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 35 | transaction failure are:
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 35 | Logical errors: Where a transaction cannot complete as a
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 35 | terminates an energetic transaction as a result of the DBMS
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 35 | transaction.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 37 | When a system crashes, it should have many transactions being
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 37 | Transactions are a product of numerous operations that are
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 37 | database, atomicity of transactions as an entire should be
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 37 | It ought to check the states of all the transactions that were
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 37 | A transaction could also be within the middle of some
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 37 | sure the atomicity of the transaction during this case.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 37 | It ought to check whether or not the transaction is
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 37 | No transactions would be allowed to go away from the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 38 | atomicity of a transaction:
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 38 | Maintaining the logs of every transaction, and writing them
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 38 | When a transaction enters the system and starts execution,
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 38 | Recovery with concurrent transactions (Automated Recovery):
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 38 | When over one transaction is being executed in parallel, the logs
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 39 | the transaction, such checkpoints are marked, and the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 39 | transaction is executed then using the steps of the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 39 | transaction, the log files will be created.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 39 | When it reaches to the checkpoint, then the transaction
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 39 | transaction till next checkpoint and so on.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 39 | DBMS was in the consistent state, and all transactions were
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | The transaction is put into redo state if the recovery system
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | transactions are removed and then redone before saving
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | For example: In the log file, transaction T2 and T3 will have
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | <Tn, Start> and <Tn, Commit>. The T1 transaction will have
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | transaction is committed after the checkpoint is crossed.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | Hence it puts T1, T2 and T3 transaction into redo list.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | The transaction is put into undo state if the recovery
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | log found. In the undo-list, all the transactions are undone,
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | For example: Transaction T4 will have <Tn, Start>. So T4
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 40 | will be put into undo list since this transaction is not yet
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 41 | A deadlock is a condition where two or more transactions are
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 41 | In a database, when a transaction waits indefinitely to obtain a

DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 42 | every transaction which is waiting for some data held by
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 42 | operations of the transaction whether they can create a
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 42 | allowed that transaction to be executed.
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | In this scheme, if a transaction requests for a resource which is
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | already held with a conflicting lock by another transaction then
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | the DBMS simply checks the timestamp of both transactions. It
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | allows the older transaction to wait until the resource is available
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | Let's assume there are two transactions Ti and Tj and let TS(T) is
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | a timestamp of any transaction T. If T2 holds a lock by some
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | other transaction and T1 is requesting for resources held by T2
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | 1. Check if TS(Ti) < TS(Tj) - If Ti is the older transaction and Tj
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | transaction is waiting for a resource which is locked by the
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | younger transaction, then the older transaction is allowed
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | 2. Check if TS(T) < TS(Tj) - If Ti is older transaction and has
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | In wound wait scheme, if the older transaction requests for
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | a resource which is held by the younger transaction, then
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | older transaction forces younger one to kill the transaction
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | younger transaction is restarted but with the same
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | If the older transaction has held a resource which is
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | requested by the Younger transaction, then the younger
DBMS(UT-5).pdf | Page 43 | transaction is asked to wait until older releases it.
